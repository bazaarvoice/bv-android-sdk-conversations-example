# Conversations Example App

Follow the [Installation Instructions](https://bazaarvoice.github.io/bv-android-sdk/installation.html#configure-bvsdk)
to generate your bvsdk_config_staging.json and bvsdk_config_prod.json files and add them to the 
app/src/main/assets/ directory.

If you launch the MainActivity then you should see 2 buttons. One to Display Reviews, and one 
to Submit a Review.

You will need to add in a valid product id, and author id in the app/src/main/com/example/conversations/Constants.java 
file.
